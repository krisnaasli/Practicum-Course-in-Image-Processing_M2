# Practicum-Course-in-Image-Processing_M2
## Description
### There are 4 assignments from Module 2 of the Practicum in Image Processing which are 4 units in 1 project as follows:
#### * Practical Exercise 1 (Unit1.pas)
Practice 1 consists of one main window (Form1) that has a user interface (UI) component TImage (Image1).
The purpose of this application is to display a window containing a TImage (Image1) component, which can be used to display an image. However, in the given implementation, the FormCreate procedure has no code in it, so this application will only display an empty window with no image.
So, this application is a basic framework for displaying an image inside a window using the TImage component in Delphi.
#### * Practical Exercise 2 (Unit2.pas)
Practice 2 consists of one main window (Form2) that has one TImage user interface (UI) component (Image1).
The purpose of this application is to display a window containing an image. The image is loaded from a file with the name "photo-image-bati-cute-cute.jpg" located in the "Images" folder.
So, this application is a simple application that displays an image in a window using the TImage component in Delphi.
#### * Practical Exercise 3 Image Viewer Program (Unit3.pas)
Practice 3 consists of a main window (TForm) with various user interface (UI) components, including buttons (TButton), checkboxes (TCheckBox), images (TImage), and an image opening dialog (TOpenPictureDialog).
The purpose of this application is to allow the user to load an image from a selected file using the picture opening dialog. Once the image is loaded, the user can set image display properties such as center, stretch, proportionality, and auto-size through the available checkboxes. The "Original Size" button allows users to restore the image to its original size after making changes.
So, this application is a simple program to load, display, and manage the display properties of an image in the Delph environment.
#### * Post Test (Unit4.pas)
The Post Test consists of a main window (TForm) that has several user interface (UI) components, including a main menu (TMainMenu), an image (TImage), and an image opening dialog (TOpenPictureDialog).
The purpose of this application is to allow the user to load an image from a selected file using the image opening dialog. Once the image is loaded, the user can execute a horizontal flip operation on the loaded image.
Thus, this application is a simple program for loading an image, performing a horizontal flip operation, and displaying the results within the Delphi environment.
